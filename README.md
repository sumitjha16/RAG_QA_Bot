> Note: The first time you run this, it might take a while to build all the images and download the embedding models.

1. You will need an API key from Cohere Api. You can create one for free here:
    - [Cohere Api ](https://cohere.com) - to use models like Cohere (Recommended since it's free)
    - [OpenIA](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) - to use models like GPT4
2. Set up your API keys in a file called `.env` (see `.env.example` for an example)

3. Now set up the backend and frontend

    ```shell
    docker compose up
    ```

    Or if in case you don't have docker or facing any issue then you can run backend and frontend individually like this
